<!--
This repository provides the PlotQA dataset which deals with the task of question-answering over a very specific class of images, namely scientific plots such as bar plots, line plots, and dot-line plots. This work is to be presented at <a href="https://wacv20.wacv.net/" target="_blank">WACV 2020</a>.

### What is PlotQA?
PlotQA is a VQA dataset with 28.9 million question-answer pairs grounded over 224,377 plots on data from real-world sources and questions based on crowd-sourced question templates. 

### Why PlotQA?
Existing synthetic datasets ([FigureQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07300.pdf), [DVQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08163.pdf)) for reasoning over plots do not contain variability in data labels, real-valued data, or complex reasoning questions. Consequently, proposed models for these datasets do not fully address the challenge of reasoning over plots. In particular, they assume that the answer comes either from a small fixed size vocabulary or from a bounding box within the image. However, in practice this is an unrealistic assumption because many questions require reasoning and thus have real valued answers which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap between existing datasets and real world plots by introducing PlotQA. Further, 80.76% of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) questions in PlotQA have answers that are not in a fixed vocabulary.
